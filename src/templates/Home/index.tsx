          I&apos;m very passionate about web development because you can
          seamlessly learn a tech tool online, create a project and show it to
          the world! I believe the web should be a free place for people to show
          their work. I also like to work with teams and apply coding principles
          like SOLID, Clean Architecture and TDD to write readable and
          maintainable code.
